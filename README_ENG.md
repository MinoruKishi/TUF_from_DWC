# Experimental FORTH system to understand the FORTH language and its systems.  
  
This is a record of my understanding of forth-dwc, which began when I learned about it at the Facebook FORTH2020 group meeting.  
It is still a work in progress.  
At this stage, I am trying to understand the problem-solving process of ChatGPT (4o) and find ideas that will help me deepen my understanding of programming in my own way.
