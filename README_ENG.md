## Trying to build a game written in FORTH language using ChatGPT<br/>
Investigate whether it is possible to convert IchigoJam's river rafting game (BASIC language) into a forth-DWC program (FORTH language) using ChatGPT. Please refer to the following conversation log for details.
 

This is still in progress.
At this stage, I am trying to understand ChatGPT's problem-solving process and find ideas that will help me develop my own programming style.

I learned about forth-dwc from a conversation in the FORTH2020 group on Facebook.

# Conversation log:

## Deepening understanding of forth-dwc with ChatGPT 

[ First, I asked ChatGPT how well it understands the FORTH language ](ChatGPT_Kawakudari_01_ENG.MD)  
File:ChatGPT_Kawakudari_01  
  
I like the “river rafting game” in IchigoJam BASIC, so I wanted to replace it with FORTH language. I asked ChatGPT (4o) what I needed to consider for that.I thought it might be rejected, but I received a fairly specific and accurate response.  
  
[ Can ChatGPT (4o) and I develop the program as intended? ](ChatGPT_Kawakudari_02b_ENG.MD)  
File:ChatGPT_Kawakudari_02  
  
The purpose of this exercise was to develop a program that actually runs and can be confirmed to work as intended.I wanted to see if ChatGPT (4o) and I could work together to achieve that goal.  
  
  
[ I asked a few questions to deepen my understanding of the forth-dwc source code ](ChatGPT_Kawakudari_03_ENG.MD)  
File:ChatGPT_Kawakudari_03  
From here on, I used ChatGPT (5)  
  
Since it was confirmed that developing the “river-running game” in FORTH-DWC is feasible, I proceeded to understand the FORTH-DWC source code to begin development. I had expected ChatGPT (5) to respond with “I am not familiar with FORTH-DWC,” but it appears that ChatGPT (5)'s extensive database already contained relevant information, and it provided detailed explanations including information beyond the materials created by the FORTH-DWC developers.I was honestly surprised. I don't think it's possible, but even if ChatGPT (5) were to gloss over something it doesn't know, I wouldn't be able to tell at this point. I will continue to deepen my understanding, but I want to gain a thorough understanding before I can point out mistakes to ChatGPT (5) (though at my current pace, it might take around 100 years).
